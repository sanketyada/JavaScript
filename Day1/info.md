There are mostly two types of language
statically typed languages check data types at compile time, while dynamically typed languages check at runtime

//Dynamically Typed {
let char="rajesh"
let char2=123;
let store=true
mean it can store every type of data into the variable
}
//Statically Typed{
int a=12;
int str="snaket" //Wrong
string str="Snaket"
 it check the type of data while store into variable
}
